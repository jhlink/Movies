## Instructions

1. In order to ensure functionality of the Movies (Pt. 1) app, a file called *ENV_KEYS* must be created in the root project directory with the following text. 

`MOVIE_KEY = [_apiKey_]` 

2. In effect, the `ENV_KEYS` file should be in the same directory as the `app` directory, as noted in the `build.gradle` file when reviewing the `getKey` function.
