Note: The order of the <item> elements is important.

When this drawable is referenced, the <item> elements are traversed in-order to determine which one is appropriate for the current button state.
Because the default bitmap is last, it is only applied when the conditions android:state_pressed and android:state_focused have both evaluated as false.
